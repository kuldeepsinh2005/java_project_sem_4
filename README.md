- Roles are stored as-is in the database
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Ensure MySQL is running and credentials are correct
2. **Port Conflicts**: Change server port in `application.properties` if needed
3. **Template Errors**: Check Thymeleaf template syntax
4. **Security Issues**: Verify authentication configuration
5. **Password Issues**: Ensure BCrypt encoding is working properly

### Security Troubleshooting
1. **Authentication Failures**: Check database user table and role assignments
2. **Access Denied**: Verify user roles and URL permissions
3. **Password Encoding**: Ensure BCrypt is properly configured
4. **Session Issues**: Check session configuration and timeout settings
